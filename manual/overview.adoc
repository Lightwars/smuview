== Overview

SmuView is a graphical frontend for the libsigrok library, permitting access to
a wide range of devices to let you record, analyze, process and export analog
data. It is part of the sigrok suite, just like the libraries that it makes use
of.

The sigrok suite needs some kind of hardware to interface to the signals you
want to examine or control. SmuView currently supports a wide variarity of
analog devices like
https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Power_supplies[power supplies]
or https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Digital_loads[electronic loads].
Both of these device types are most of the time controllable. There is also a
large number of measurement devices that are supported by SmuView like
https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Multimeters[multimeters],
https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#LCR_meters[LCR meters],
https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Sound_level_meters[sound level meters],
https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Thermometers[thermometers],
https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Hygrometers[hygrometers],
https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Anemometers[anemometers],
https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Light_meters[light meters],
https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Energy_meters[energy meters],
https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Tachometers[tachometers] and
https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Scales[scales].

Please be aware that SmuView does not support devices that either work as
https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Oscilloscopes[oscilloscopes],
https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Logic_analyzers[logic analyzers] or
https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Mixed-signal_devices[mixed-signal devices].
This device types are currently only usable with either
https://sigrok.org/wiki/Sigrok-cli[sigrok-cli] or
https://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView[PulseView].

However, oscilloscopes will be supported in the future to perform high frequency
measurements (like voltage ripple on switch mode power supplies) or measurements
in the frequency domain (e.g. for filter characterization).

The SmuView user interface is geared towards controlling devices and analysis of
captured data. From here, you can access all features.

Before we dive deeper into how to accomplish things, let's make SmuView
available on your system first.
