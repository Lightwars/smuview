[[device_control,Device Control]]
== Device Control

SmuView can control devices, depending on the device type and the available
features of the connected device. When a device is connected and it is
controllable, control views  are automatically displayed.

You can close control views and create new ones via the tool bar of the device
tab.

[[control_view]]
=== Control View

Depending on the device type the control view looks different and functions may
be disabled.

Power supplies and electronic loads have a very similar control view, which
gives access to all possible functions supported by the sigrok library.

Other controllable devices like sound level meters will have a generic control
view.

[[sequence_output_view]]
=== Sequence Output View

Some <<config_key,config keys>> of a device (for example the output voltage of a
power supply) can be set to a sequence of values. The sequence can be played one
or more times. You can generate sine, triangle, sawtooth and square wave
sequences, load a sequence from a CSV file or enter the sequence manually.

There is no tool bar button in the device tab to show a sequence output view
yet, but it is accesible via the _Add View_ dialog in the device tab.
